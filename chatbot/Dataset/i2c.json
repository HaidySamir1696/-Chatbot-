In the event of the bus beingreleased by the master or a slave, the pull-up resistor (RPU) on the line is responsible for pulling the busvoltage up to the power rail. Since no device may force a high on a line, this means that the bus will neverrun into a communication issue where one device may try to transmit a high, and another transmits a low,causing a short (power rail to ground). I2C requires that if a master in a multi-master environment transmitsa high, but see's that the line is low (another device is pulling it down), to halt communications becauseanother device is using the bus.
